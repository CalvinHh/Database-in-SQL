# Database-in-SQL
This was a group project building database in SQL. My role was to:
Made an EDR table for the CustomerCity table from the backup file at the beginning.
Create normalisation process tables for Product and OrderItem with a colleague.
Created the cube used in the video and dimensions to fit all business requirements. Added Full Name (for Customers) and Total of Order Number as named Calculation in Data Source View. The Total Order Number was used as a new measure added in Calculated Members later to figure out the percentage calculations against total orders placed.
